The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing its cash hoard through stock and bond investments and share repurchases.

Export Custom Report as Excel File																																			
Follow the steps below to export a custom report as an Excel (.xlsx) file.																																			
 	Excel report exports are in XLSX format. If you are using an older version of Excel, you can install the Microsoft Compatibility Pack so that you can open XLSX files.																																		
00001	Locate the report you want to export in the custom reports section of the Reports dashboard, and click an Excel export link.																																		
		To export the report without first viewing the data, click the “Export XLS” link under the Action button menu.																																	
																																			
		 																																	
		To view the report prior to exporting, click on its linked Report Name, then click the “xls” link in the Export line directly above the report Snapshot.																																	
		NOTE: You can filter the report by Date Range or Payment Method prior to exporting it; the export will include only those transactions included by the filters.																																	
																																			
	 																																		
00002	Depending on your browser, you will have the option to open and/or save the file.																																		
	a	To open the file, click the “Open” button in the dialog box. The file will open in Excel, but will not be saved. You will need to save the file in Excel if you want to store it on your computer.																																	
																																			
		 																																	
	b	To save the file to your computer.																																	
		i	Click the “Save” button in the dialog box. 																																
																																			
			  																																
		ii	A Save As dialog box opens.																																
			NOTE: In Google Chrome, and some other browsers, clicking the “xls” link will take you directly to this step.																																
																																			
			  																																
		iii	Enter a name for your file, and select a location on your computer where you want to save the file.																																
		iv	Click the “Save” button.																																
		v	You can now open the report directly from your computer at any time, without being logged into ADP Payments.

Export Custom Report as Excel File																																			
Follow the steps below to export a custom report as an Excel (.xlsx) file.																																			
 	Excel report exports are in XLSX format. If you are using an older version of Excel, you can install the Microsoft Compatibility Pack so that you can open XLSX files.																																		
00001	Locate the report you want to export in the custom reports section of the Reports dashboard, and click an Excel export link.																																		
		To export the report without first viewing the data, click the “Export XLS” link under the Action button menu.																																	
																																			
		 																																	
		To view the report prior to exporting, click on its linked Report Name, then click the “xls” link in the Export line directly above the report Snapshot.																																	
		NOTE: You can filter the report by Date Range or Payment Method prior to exporting it; the export will include only those transactions included by the filters.																																	
																																			
	 																																		
00002	Depending on your browser, you will have the option to open and/or save the file.																																		
	a	To open the file, click the “Open” button in the dialog box. The file will open in Excel, but will not be saved. You will need to save the file in Excel if you want to store it on your computer.																																	
																																			
		 																																	
	b	To save the file to your computer.																																	
		i	Click the “Save” button in the dialog box. 																																
																																			
			  																																
		ii	A Save As dialog box opens.																																
			NOTE: In Google Chrome, and some other browsers, clicking the “xls” link will take you directly to this step.																																
																																			
			  																																
		iii	Enter a name for your file, and select a location on your computer where you want to save the file.																																
		iv	Click the “Save” button.																																
		v	You can now open the report directly from your computer at any time, without being logged into ADP Payments.
